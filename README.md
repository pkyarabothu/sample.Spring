==============

This open source integration demonstrates Spring and Spring MVC integration through a simple phonebook sample Web application deployed to Liberty.

This sample demonstrates Spring and Spring MVC integration through a simple phonebook Web application deployed to Liberty.

This sample can be installed onto runtime versions 8.5.5.0 and later.



## Maven
### Running in Eclipse with Maven

1. Clone this project and import into Eclipse as an 'Existing Maven Project'.
2. Right-click the project and select **Run As > Run on Server**.
3. You should see the following in the console: `Application sample.spring started in XX.XX seconds.`

### Running with Maven command-line

This project can be built with [Apache Maven]. The project uses [Liberty Maven Plug-in] to automatically download and install the Liberty Java EE 7 Full Platform runtime from [Maven Central]. Liberty Maven Plug-in is also used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server. 

Use the following steps to run the application with Maven:

1. Execute the full Maven build. The Liberty Maven Plug-in will download and install the Liberty runtime and create the server.
    ```bash
    $ mvn clean install
    ```

2. To run the server with the Spring application execute:
    ```bash
    $ mvn liberty:run-server
    ```

## Gradle
### Running in Eclipse with Gradle
1. Go to Help > Eclipse Marketplace > Install Buildship Gradle Integration 2.0.
2. Clone this project and import into Eclipse as an 'Existing Gradle Project'.
3. Go to Window > Show View > Other > Gradle Executions & Gradle Tasks.
4. Go to Gradle Tasks view and run clean in build folder, then build in build folder, then libertyStart in liberty folder.
5. You should see the following in the console: `Application sample.spring started in XX.XX seconds.`

 
### Running with Gradle command-line

This project can be built with [Gradle]. The project uses [Liberty Gradle Plug-in] to automatically download and install Liberty with Java EE 7 Full Platform runtime from [Maven Central]. Liberty Gradle Plug-in is also used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server. 

Use the following steps to run the application with Gradle:

1. Execute full Gradle build. This will cause Liberty Gradle Plug-in to download and install Liberty profile server.
    ```bash
    $ gradle clean build
    ```

2. To run the server with the Spring application execute:
    ```bash
    $ gradle libertyStart
    ```
        
3. To stop the server with the Spring application execute:
    ```bash
    $ gradle libertyStop
    ```
 

In your browser, enter the URL for the application: [http://localhost:9811/sample.spring/](http://localhost:9811/sample.spring/) (where port 9811 assumes the httpEndpoint provided in the sample server.xml has not been modified).
In your browser, you should see the phone book displayed.
